# Rainfall Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Description
This project focuses on predicting rainfall using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical weather data, the goal is to build a model that accurately predicts whether rainfall will occur on a given day. The model uses weather-related features such as temperature, humidity, and pressure to make predictions.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to:
- Predict the occurrence of rainfall based on historical weather data.
- Explore and apply machine learning algorithms for weather forecasting.
- Provide valuable insights for weather prediction and related applications, such as agriculture and disaster management.

## How It Works
This project follows the steps below to achieve accurate rainfall predictions:

### 1. Data Collection
Historical weather data is gathered, including key features like:
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Pressure
- Wind speed

### 2. Data Preprocessing
The data is cleaned and prepared for the machine learning model:
- Handling missing values.
- Standardizing features for uniformity.
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing subsets.

### 3. Feature Engineering
Key meteorological features are derived:
- Attributes such as vapor pressure and spatial satellite-derived estimates are used to improve model predictions.
- Rolling up time series data for forecasts over daily or weekly periods.

### 4. Model Selection and Training
Various machine learning algorithms are tested, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Advanced neural networks like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs)

A hybrid model combining CNNs and LSTMs is utilized for this study. It leverages:
- CNN's spatial analysis capabilities.
- LSTM's ability to capture temporal dependencies in time-series data.

### 5. Model Evaluation
Model performance is assessed using metrics such as:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score

Cross-validation techniques and hyperparameter optimization ensure the model's reliability and robustness.

### 6. Prediction
The trained model predicts rainfall on unseen data, providing localized, high-resolution forecasts that are particularly useful for real-time applications like:
- Agriculture
- Flood control
- Disaster management

## Conclusion
This project successfully implements machine learning techniques to address the challenges of rainfall prediction. The hybrid CNN-LSTM model demonstrated its ability to effectively predict rainfall with a higher degree of accuracy compared to traditional machine learning methods. The model is scalable, adaptable to real-time data streams, and capable of delivering localized forecasts.
